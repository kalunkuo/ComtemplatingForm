Audio visualization: auditory-visual connection through the theme of mediation

<br>This project aims to explore the potential of establishing an auditory-visual connection through the theme of mediation. To achieve this, I selected the sound of a temple bell as the background audio, as it symbolizes sanctuary and auspiciousness. The recursive sound of the bell, with its repetitive pattern and contemplative quality, resonates with the listener, creating a sense of harmony and peace. To visually represent this connection, the team designed a mechanism that responds to the amplitude of the audio by creating a series of curves that gradually circulate around a central point on the screen. This design is intended to create a sense of surprise and wonder for the audience, as the movement of the curve is unexpected yet harmonious with the sound.

<br>As the piece progresses, the mechanism connects to additional pin-points along the edges of the display, forming thousands of curves that are animated with the audio. I used this simple yet powerful mechanism to continuously manipulate, overlay, and recreate the curves, resulting in a complex and dynamic three-dimensional form that is revealed at certain moments. By engaging both the auditory and visual senses of the audience, this project creates a unique and immersive experience that blurs the boundaries between sound and image. The result is a captivating and contemplative piece that encourages the audience to reflect and meditate.
